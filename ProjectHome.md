A simple and easy to use flashcard application for practicing Kanji on the Android operating system. This project is open source for two reasons:

1) the small reason, because the code could probably be better. It's fairly simple but it was also the first Android thing I ever did and I haven't much touched it since making it work the first time.

2) the big reason, I don't actually know Japanese or Kanji or anything that this application is supposed to help with practicing. I made it for my girlfriend who was interested in learning Japanese at the time and I thought it would be a really simple introduction to Android development. She didn't pursue the Japanese that far so the many mistakes that I left in here are probably still there. That's where I figured people could really help with fixes.
