#summary The to-do list for the Kanji flashcards application

Welcome! This page is a list of things to do for the Kanji flashcards android application. Listed first are the errors in translations and data. The data and translations for the whole set of Kanji are in the file http://code.google.com/p/kanji-flashcards-android/source/browse/trunk/res/xml/lessons.xml. If there are any errors you see let me know at joe@daverin.com

  * Put in a link in the menu to open a browser link to a wiki page on this site where users can report errors.
  * "I would love to get a feature "autoplay quiz mode" that just shows kanji/kana a couple of seconds and then goes on  to the next one without needing me for pressing a button"
  * "it would be helpful if the signs would appear larger in this mode as I have to recognize them from half a meter away"
